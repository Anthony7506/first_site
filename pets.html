            <p>Brown and White Bichon/Shih Tzu mix</p>
            <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house, she is very quick to run
                up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you alone with her toys as she begs you to
                play with her.</p>
            <p>Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch, she is quick to find a spot next to you. If
                you wear a blanket over your legs, you'll find her laying on your legs. She loves to cuddle and loves to
                be pet, so she will always be right up on you.</p>

                    <p class="likes">Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his
                        bone or tennis ball.
                        He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods are
                        kibble and peanut butter.
                        Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>
                    <p class="likes">My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months old
                        and is now 8 years old.
                        Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once; however,
                        he quickly recovered and has been doing great since.</p>

                    <p>Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix. Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. She
                        loves to go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly. Sofie
                        loves freshly cut grass; she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut.</p>
                    <p>Sofie is very old; she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends
                        because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on
                        the trail, where she can be let free to run to her heart's content.</p>

                    <p>River is a 7-year-old Bichon Frise. Though he is aging, he is extremely active and loves to play.
                        He likes to throw things. He will throw his ball down the stairs and play fetch with himself if
                        you don't give him attention. He will also throw his food and water bowl to let us know he wants
                        more.</p>
                    <p>River is obsessed with my mom. My mom is the one who mostly walks him and gives him treats.
                        Anywhere my mom goes, River follows. If she's gone for 2 minutes, he will frantically search the
                        house for her. Although he likes being with people, he hates being cuddled or held.</p>
