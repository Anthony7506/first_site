                    <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house, she is very quick
                        to
                        run
                        up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you alone with her toys as she
                        begs
                        you to
                        play with her.</p>
                    <p>Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch, she is quick to find a spot next to
                        you.
                        If
                        you wear a blanket over your legs, you'll find her laying on your legs. She loves to cuddle and
                        loves to
                        be pet, so she will always be right up on you.</p>

                        <p class="likes">Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his
                            bone or tennis ball.
                            He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods
                            are
                            kibble and peanut butter.
                            Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>
                        <p class="likes">My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months
                            old
                            and is now 8 years old.
                            Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once;
                            however,
                            he quickly recovered and has been doing great since.</p>
